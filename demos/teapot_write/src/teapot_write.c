/* ====================================================================
 * nanoPRC write-facility example: generate a complete .prc file from
 * scratch (no input PDF/PRC file is read).
 *
 * This is the companion to demos/quick_start (which shows how to READ a
 * .prc file); this demo shows how to WRITE one, using only the public API
 * declared in include/prc_api.h -- nothing here reaches into the library's
 * internal src/ headers, so everything below is something your own code
 * can do too.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     nano_prc_teapot_write [output.prc] [output.pdf]
 * (defaults to "utah_teapot.prc"/"utah_teapot.pdf" in the current directory
 * if no paths are given). Writes both a plain .prc file and the same
 * geometry embedded in a minimal 3D-annotated PDF (see Step 6 below); open
 * either in any PRC-capable viewer (nanoPRC's own nano_prc_viewer demo,
 * Adobe Reader/Acrobat, or a third-party PRC reader) to see the classic
 * Utah teapot -- the sample model created by Martin Newell at the
 * University of Utah in 1975, a de facto standard test object in computer
 * graphics ever since. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot for
 * its history; the control-point data used below (teapot_patches) is the
 * classic 32-patch Bezier formulation of that model.
 *
 * THE THREE-LEVEL SHAPE OF THE WRITE API
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every .prc file nanoPRC writes is built from three levels, assembled
 * bottom-up when you fill in the structs but read top-down once you see
 * the finished file:
 *
 *   1. prc_api_write_tessellation -- one raw piece of geometry: a
 *      position array, a triangle index array grouped into "faces" (each
 *      face gets its own normal), and optionally per-vertex normals if
 *      you already have them. You supply an ARRAY of these; each one is
 *      later referred to by a 1-based ("biased") index.
 *
 *   2. prc_api_write_rep_item -- a "representation item": a pointer from
 *      the product/part tree to ONE entry of that tessellation array,
 *      plus a `kind` (SURFACE for triangulated shells, WIRE for
 *      line/polyline geometry -- this demo only uses SURFACE).
 *
 *   3. prc_api_write_node -- one node of the product/part assembly tree.
 *      A node with representation items attached becomes a "part" with
 *      its own bounding box; every node (with or without a part) becomes
 *      a "product occurrence" that can nest children for sub-assemblies.
 *      The simplest possible scene -- and the one this demo builds -- is
 *      a single root node with one representation item and no children.
 *
 * Once you have those three pieces, prc_api_write_prc_file() does
 * everything else: it deflate-compresses each section, assembles the
 * ISO 14739 section framing and offset tables, and writes the complete
 * file in one call.
 *
 * WHAT'S NOT HERE YET
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The write facility does not yet expose colors/materials/styles/pictures
 * through the public API (every representation item gets the reader's
 * default appearance), and it writes exactly one file structure (no
 * multi-file cross-references). See the "Write facility" section of
 * include/prc_api.h for the current, authoritative list of what is and
 * isn't implemented.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Sample geometry: the Utah teapot, as 32 bicubic Bezier patches (a NURBS
 * patch with unit weights and a Bezier-clamped knot vector is exactly a
 * plain Bezier patch, so no weight/knot machinery is needed to evaluate
 * this classic dataset). This part of the file has nothing to do with
 * nanoPRC's API -- it is just a way to generate some interesting
 * triangles to write out. Skip to teapot_build_mesh() and main() below if
 * you just want to see the API calls.

   adjacent patches share their boundary row/column of control points, so
   sampling right to the edge makes neighboring patches meet exactly
   (Bezier patches are fully determined by their control points, so two
   patches sharing a boundary control-point row evaluate identical points
   all along it) -- no explicit cross-patch vertex welding needed for the
   surface to look seamless, just matching positions.

   8 of the 32 patches (the lid tip and the base) additionally collapse
   one whole control-point row to a single point, so sampling AT that row
   (u or v = 0 or 1, whichever collapses) makes every vertex in it
   coincide and the triangles touching it degenerate (zero area). That's
   harmless here: prc_write_tess_3d (the uncompressed encoder this demo
   uses) does no deduplication or quantization, so a degenerate triangle
   just renders as an invisible sliver, not an error. (The original
   geometry generator this was adapted from, tests/unit/test_compress_
   tess.c, sampled inset from the boundary instead -- it exercises the
   *compressed* encoder's quantized vertex welding, where a degenerate
   triangle becomes a welded-away point that has to be excluded from
   both sides of a centroid cross-check by hand. That concern doesn't
   apply here, so this demo samples the full range instead and gets a
   seamless surface.) */

       every grid point has exactly one position AND one normal, so
       norm_indices can reuse `tris` verbatim (the same vertex index

       has_faces was fixed, an outright "invalid vector subscript"
       exception) from an independent reader used for ground-truth
       verification. Root-caused via real, independently-produced reference
       files (not just spec reading): (1) this encoder's C1 path wrote a
       genuinely empty line_attribute_array, while every real producer
       writes at least one entry; (2) once fixed to write exactly one
       entry, that only matched reference files with a single face --
       multi-face content needs one entry PER FACE, which a real,
       multi-face reference file confirmed; (3) has_faces was earlier
       (wrongly) believed to require TRUE whenever triangle_face_array has
       real data -- a real multi-face reference file has has_faces FALSE
       with genuinely multi-valued triangle_face_array, so it was reverted
       to FALSE (this write facility never emits exact B-Rep geometry, and
       has_faces means "built from real topological faces", not "has
       triangle-to-style groupings"). With all three fixed, this teapot
       (2592 verts, 4096 tris, 2048 faces) now reads back via that
       independent reader as real, non-null geometry: 4032 of 4096
       triangles, which is CORRECT, not a shortfall -- teapot_patches[]'s
       patches 20-23 (the lid's top pole) and 28-31 (the base's center
       pole) each have all four control points of one grid row set to the
       exact same point ({0,0,3.15} and {0,0,0} respectively, the classic
       Utah teapot dataset's pole/apex construction), so every sample along
       that row of each of those 8 patches coincides regardless of the
       other parameter. Each of the resulting 8 quads per pole patch (64
       quads total across all 8 pole patches) therefore has one zero-area
       (degenerate) triangle and one real one; this write facility's own
       preprocessing correctly welds/drops the degenerate ones, so
       4096 - 64 == 4032 real triangles is exactly right. Confirmed by
       inspecting the independent reader's own per-face triangle-index
       counts: precisely those 64 faces (8 groups of 8, matching the 8
       pole patches' first grid row) have 3 indices (1 triangle) instead
       of 6 (2 triangles); every other face has the full 6. */
