/* ====================================================================
 * nanoPRC STL importer: read an STL mesh (binary or ASCII) and write it
 * out as a .prc file and a minimal 3D-annotated .pdf, using only the
 * public write API declared in include/prc_api.h -- the same one
 * demos/teapot_write uses, and worth reading first if you haven't seen it;
 * this demo assumes familiarity with its "three-level shape of the write
 * API" explanation (tessellation -> representation item -> tree node)
 * rather than repeating it here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     nano_prc_stl_import <input.stl> [output.prc] [output.pdf]
 *                          [--original-normals] [--weld-tolerance F]
 * Output paths default to the input file's own basename with .stl swapped
 * for .prc/.pdf if omitted. --original-normals and --weld-tolerance are
 * documented where they're used below (stl_options_parse) and in the
 * per-part tessellation build step (stl_import_build_tess_entries).
 *
 * THE STL FORMAT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STL ("STereoLithography", sometimes backronymed "Standard Triangle
 * Language") originated as the native format of 3D Systems' first
 * stereolithography CAD software in 1987. Unlike PRC/PDF (ISO 14739 /
 * ISO 32000) it was never formally standardized by ISO or any other body
 * -- "the STL format" means the union of what 3D Systems' own (public
 * domain, informally circulated) "StereoLithography Interface
 * Specification" describes and what decades of divergent tool
 * implementations actually produce. See
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) for the format's
 * history and a good description of both variants parsed here:
 *
 *   - BINARY: an 80-byte free-form header (frequently, but not always,
 *     conventional ASCII text -- never parsed for meaning by a compliant
 *     reader), a little-endian uint32 triangle count, then that many
 *     50-byte facet records: a 3-float facet normal, three 3-float
 *     vertices, and a 2-byte "attribute byte count" field. That last
 *     field is a vendor extension slot (some tools stash a 16-bit color
 *     in it) this importer does not interpret.
 *   - ASCII: whitespace- and case-insensitive keyword syntax,
 *     `solid [name]` ... repeated `facet normal ni nj nk` / `outer loop`
 *     / three `vertex x y z` lines / `endloop` / `endfacet` ... blocks
 *     ... `endsolid [name]`.
 *
 * Both variants describe pure "triangle soup": every facet carries its
 * own independent 3 vertices, even where two facets share an edge in the
 * intended geometry, and there is no shared-vertex index, no face
 * grouping beyond one-facet-at-a-time, and no part/assembly structure at
 * all -- everything PRC's tree/tessellation model expects but STL simply
 * doesn't carry has to be reconstructed here: vertex welding (Step 2,
 * stl_weld_mesh) to get a genuinely connected mesh instead of a pile of
 * disconnected triangles, and connected-component analysis (also Step 2)
 * to notice when the welded mesh is actually several disjoint parts and
 * give each its own PRC tree node.
 * ==================================================================== */

/* Research option (default OFF): when a welded STL splits into multiple
   disjoint connected components, the DEFAULT behavior (stl_import_build_
   parts, below) gives each component its own PRC_TYPE_ASM_FileStructure
   Tessellation entry, rep item, and 3-level tree branch (root ->
   intermediate[empty part] -> leaf[real part]). At real-world STL-scan
   scale that can mean tens or hundreds of thousands of tree nodes and
   tessellation entries sharing one file structure's bitstream section --
   Adobe Acrobat/Reader are independently known to have performance
   problems with very large/deep model trees, and this investigation has
   also seen a from-scratch bitstream corruption (an independent reader
   disagreeing with our own writer, not just Acrobat being stricter --
   see the "beetle_1000000.stl entry #397" notes in this repo's PRC/STL
   investigation writeup) that is specific to writing many sequential
   COMPRESSED entries into one shared section.

   This is a THRESHOLD, not a boolean: 0 (the default) means "never" --
   always use the default per-component-model behavior, unconditionally.
   A positive value N means "when a welded STL has more than N disjoint
   components, build exactly ONE tessellation entry, ONE rep item, and
   ONE tree leaf for the whole mesh instead, with every connected
   component encoded as its own FACE GROUP within that single entry
   (prc_api_write_tessellation's face_tri_counts/num_faces) rather than
   as a separate model." This trades away per-part identity in the model
   tree (all components collapse into one named node) in exchange for a
   flat tree and a single tessellation entry regardless of how many
   disjoint pieces the STL contains.

   Left at 0 until the face-group encoding has itself been validated
   end-to-end against the real-world files driving this investigation
   (beetle_1000000.stl / UK_original.stl) -- once confirmed correct, this
   is the natural default to flip on (e.g. to 20) for STL-scan-scale
   inputs, per-file, with no CLI flag needed. */

   Every allocation in this file that scales with a value read from (or
   derived from counting through) an untrusted input file goes through
   this rather than a bare `malloc(count * elem_size)` -- STL's binary
   triangle count is a full uint32 with no inherent upper bound beyond
   what the file's own declared size implies (checked separately, in
   stl_is_binary), and this importer is meant to handle real multi-
   million-triangle meshes, so `count` legitimately gets large enough that
   the multiplication itself, not just the resulting allocation, needs
   guarding -- particularly on a 32-bit build, where size_t is only 32
   bits and a wraparound here would silently return a too-small buffer
   that a subsequent fixed-stride write loop then overruns. Returns 0 and
   sets *out on success; returns -1 (leaving *out untouched) on overflow,

   magnitude shorter than the other two -- three nearly-collinear points).
   Neither contributes meaningful surface detail. Filtering here, before
   these triangles reach vertex welding or the write API, isn't just
   hygiene: real customer STL data (from a mesh-cutting operation) was
   found, during this importer's own real-world dataset testing, to
   contain both kinds and to trigger a write/decode-path bug
   (`points_is_reference_index out of range` from an otherwise-unrelated
   part of the library, `prc_decode_compressed_tess.c`, when reading the
   written file back) when they reached the COMPRESSED tessellation
   encoder -- an exactly-zero-area triangle alone was not sufficient to
   reproduce it; a cluster of extreme slivers (aspect ratios from ~2e4 up
   to several million, confirmed by direct inspection of the failing
   triangles) in the same region was. Degenerate input the encoder isn't
   expected to handle gracefully either way, and none of it carries real
   geometric information, so this drops both classes rather than
   depending on downstream encoder robustness to either.
   `area_threshold` is an absolute area (not squared); `aspect_threshold`
   bounds `longest_edge^2 / area` (dimensionally a length, so it scales
   naturally with `area_threshold` -- see the caller for how both are

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Section 2: vertex welding + connected-component analysis.
 *
 * STL's triangle soup gives every facet its own private 3 vertices, even
 * along edges shared with a neighboring facet in the intended geometry.
 * This section merges vertices that coincide within a tolerance (a
 * classic spatial-hash weld: quantize each point to a grid cell sized to
 * the tolerance, then check only that cell and its 26 neighbors for an
 * existing point within range -- checking neighbors, not just the same
 * cell, is what makes this correct across a cell boundary; checking real
 * distance afterward, not just cell membership, is what keeps two
 * unrelated points sharing a cell from being wrongly merged), then does a
 * union-find flood-fill over the now-welded triangles to find connected
 * components -- each becomes its own PRC tree node in Section 3.
 *
 * This is done here in the demo rather than left entirely to
 * PRC_API_WRITE_TESS_KIND_COMPRESSED's own internal tolerance-based weld
 * (include/prc_api.h) for one reason that has nothing to do with which
 * tessellation kind ends up on the wire: Section 4 below writes
 * COMPRESSED, which does its own tolerance-based vertex weld internally
 * (redundant but harmless on data already welded to the same tolerance --
 * see Section 4's own comment), but that internal weld is opaque to the
 * caller. Section 4's connected-component split into separate PRC tree
 * nodes needs an explicit adjacency graph over welded vertices, which only
 * exists if this demo builds it itself.
 *
 * (History note, since an earlier version of this comment cited it as the
 * reason to prefer TRIANGLES over COMPRESSED: include/prc_api.h's
 * prc_api_write_tess_kind_t used to warn that an independent, non-nanoPRC
 * PRC reader returned null/empty geometry for every COMPRESSED-written
 * file. That was a real bug (large-mesh shard corruption in the encoder),
 * but it was fixed and independently confirmed rendering correctly in
 * both Adobe Acrobat and PDF-XChange -- see that header's own doc comment
 * for the current, authoritative guidance. COMPRESSED is used below both
 * because it's now confirmed solid and because its EdgeBreaker-style
 * traversal encoding gives meaningfully smaller output files than
 * TRIANGLES at the multi-million-triangle scale a real-world STL import
 * needs to handle.)
