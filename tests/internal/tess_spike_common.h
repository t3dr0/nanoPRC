/* INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT TOOL SUPPORT -- not part of the public API, no
   stability contract.

   Shared spike-detection primitives factored out of detect_tess_spikes.c
   (see that file's header comment for the full rationale/methodology) so
   repair_tess_spikes.c can reuse the identical adjacency-building and
   ratio-scoring logic instead of duplicating it -- including re-scoring a
   hypothetical candidate vertex position, not just the as-decoded one. */
