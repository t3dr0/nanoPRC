/* Marks a declaration as deprecated, producing a compiler warning (not an
   error) at each use site. Two macros are needed, not one, because GCC/Clang
   and MSVC disagree on where the annotation must go on a typedef:
     GCC/Clang : typedef OldType NewName __attribute__((deprecated(msg)));  (postfix)
     MSVC      : typedef __declspec(deprecated(msg)) OldType NewName;      (prefix)
   Putting __declspec in the postfix slot is a hard MSVC syntax error
   (confirmed: C2054), so each macro is a no-op on the compiler that doesn't
   use that slot; use BOTH at every deprecated-typedef site (see prc_api.h)
   and exactly one of the two will expand to anything for a given compiler.
   Other compilers get no-ops for both, so an unrecognized toolchain still
   compiles (just without the warning). */
