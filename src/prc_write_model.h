   structure that owns the actual root product occurrence -- NOT the root
   product's own ContentPRCRefBase.unique_id (confirmed the hard way: an
   external reader failed to resolve a reference written as the latter).
   Always written {PRC_WRITE_FILE_STRUCT_UID0,0,0,0} here, matching the
   single file structure this write facility ever produces, whose own
   identity (main header's file_info[0].unique_id and the file-structure-
   header's unique_id_file) is likewise always that same value -- all
   non-zero, per prc_write_common.h's PRC_WRITE_FILE_STRUCT_UID0 doc
   comment (zero was confirmed to be rejected as a null/invalid sentinel
   by at least one external reader). This codebase's own reader
   (prc_api_prep_model_tree) does not actually consult this reference --
   it just takes the last product of the last file structure's products[]
   array -- but other PRC consumers do, so it is still written correctly.
   root_biased_index is ProductOccurrenceReference.root_index: a BIASED
   (1-based, 0 = none) index into the referenced file structure's
   products[] array, like every other cross-reference in this format --
   pass prc_write_tree_to_stream's *root_biased_index_out. model_name is
   the model file's own base.name (NULL for unnamed, in which case
   nanoPRC's own reader falls back to the literal name "model" -- see
   prc_parse_model_file). file_struct_count is always 1 in this write

/* Top-level orchestration: assembles a complete, single-file-structure PRC
   byte stream into one heap buffer (caller frees with prc_free). Encodes
   globals/tree/tessellation independently, deflates each (plus the
   ASM_ModelFile section), then -- since every section's compressed size is
   known before anything is written -- computes the whole file's layout up
   front and writes it in a single forward pass: main header -> file-
   structure header -> schema+globals section -> tree section ->
   tessellation section -> geometry section -> model section (last). The
   model section is deliberately placed LAST, immediately after every
   regular section: confirmed against a real PRC stream (extracted from
   examples/cube.pdf) that this is the actual convention, and at least one
   third-party reader relies on the regular sections being contiguous up to
   the model section's start_offset rather than merely trusting each
   section's own stored offset. This is the one real encoder; both
   prc_write_prc_file (below) and the PDF-embedding path build on it rather
   than re-deriving the section layout independently. `tables` is mutated:
   prc_write_add_default_style adds one default gray material/style to it
   before the globals section is written, so every part/product/rep-item
   in the tree can reference a real style instead of leaving the file
   with a completely empty style table (see prc_write_tree_to_stream's
   default_biased_style_index doc comment for why). */
