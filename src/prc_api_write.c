/* Implementation of the public write-facility entry point declared in
   include/prc_api.h. This is a thin wrapper: prc_api_write_node,
   prc_api_write_rep_item, and prc_api_write_tessellation are the same
   types the internal encoder (prc_write_tree.c / prc_write_file_structure.c
   / prc_write_model.c) already works with -- prc_write_tree_node etc. are
   typedef aliases of these public types, not separate copies -- so no
   conversion step is needed here, only supplying the (currently always
   empty) global color/material/style table those internals require. */
